# Surveillance camera

This project consists of a security camera that will send a push notification with a picture when motion is detected. After detecting motion, a recording will be made and uploaded to Firebase. The dashboard can be used to enable/disable the camera, view the timeline of recordings, and change the settings.

_WIP: Mention led and buzzer_

**Team:** Kobe DevillÃ©, Jonas Di Dier, Dante Weverbergh

_WIP: Add more and final screenshot_
_TIP: Write images on same line to place them side by side_
