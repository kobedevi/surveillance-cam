# Surveillance camera

This project consists of a security camera that will send a push notification with a picture when motion is detected. After detecting motion, a recording will be made and uploaded to Firebase. The dashboard can be used to enable/disable the camera, view the timeline of recordings, and change the settings. LEDs can be connected to indicate the state of the camera and recording.

- Add a cron job to automatically delete old files
  - Run `crontab -e` to edit the cron table
  - Write `0 0 * * * python3 /home/pi/surveillance-camera/app/pi/cron.py` (adjust the path if needed)
  - Save and exit
- Run `cd surveillance-camera && python3 app/pi/src/main.py`

### Dashboard

This repository provides a default dashboard for demonstration purposes. If you want to visit this dashboard, use the steps provided [above](#Demo). If you want to recreate this project, follow these instructions to link your own Firebase project.

1. Go to the Firebase console by visiting firebase.google.com and add a new project. (A detailed guide can be found in the [Firebase documentations](https://firebase.google.com/docs/web/setup?sdk_version=v8)).
1. Connect your Raspberry Pi:
   - Go to _Project settings > Service accounts_ and generate a new private key. This will download a json file to your local drive.
   - Copy this file to your Raspberry Pi, inside the folder /app/pi/src/Firebase.
   - Alternatively, copy the content of this file to the provided serviceAccountKey.example.json.
   - Rename the file to serviceAccountKey.json
1. Connect the dashboard:
   - From the Firebase console, add a web app.
   - Provide a nickname and make sure to set up Firebase Hosting.
   - Run the command `npm install -g firebase-hosting` in your terminal.
   - From the root of the web app, run `firebase login`, followed by `firebase init`.
   - Go to _Project settings_ in the console and copy the Firebase configuration object under _General > Your apps > SDK setup and configuration > Config_.
   - Navigate to /src/core/services/firebase.js and replace the object with the one you copied.
1. Configure Cloud Messaging:
   - Inside the Project settings, go to the _Cloud Messaging_ tab and generate a key pair.
   - Copy the key, navigate to /src/core/hooks/useRegistrationToken.js and replace the provided vapidKey with your key.
1. Enable Firestore:
   - Go to _Build > Firestore Database_ and create a new database.
1. Enable Authentication:
   - Go to _Build > Authentication_ and click _Get started_.
   - Enable _Email/Password_ as sign-in provider.
   - Go to the tab _Users_ and add a user. The credentials you provide will be used to login to the dashboard.
1. Build and deploy:
   - Navigate to the root of the web application (/app/web) and run `yarn install`.
   - Run `yarn build`, followed by `firebase deploy`. Your dashboard is now available online.
   - Open the URL on a mobile device and install the application as a PWA (_Add to home screen_).
   - Open the application from your home screen and log in with the account you provided earlier.
